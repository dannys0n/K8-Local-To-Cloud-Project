# Kubernetes Dev Environment Setup

This repository contains scripts and configurations for setting up a Kubernetes cluster with monitoring, database connectors, and a Helm-managed Portainer instance.

## Getting Started

### 1. Init Environment
Run `src/scripts/start-config.sh` to create required paths and dependencies.

### 2. Deployment Configuration
`src/databases/redis.yaml` and `src/databases/postgres.yaml` define the database exposed via Kubernetes services.

### 3. Separate Services
- `src/scripts/monitor-service.yaml`: Exposes monitoring endpoints.
- `src/test-service/echo.yaml`: Provides a simple health check endpoint.
- `src/scripts/monitors.sh`: Automates deployments through Helm and manages Portainer.

### 4. Helm Charts
All cluster resources are managed via Helm charts, covering Grafana, Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana, and Postgres.

### 5. Running the Stack
Start with:
```bash
./src/scripts/start-config.sh
```

## Configuration Tips
- Adjust values in `src/managing/portainer-values.yaml` for Portainer deployment.
- Ensure kube-prometheus-stack is installed before testing.
- Monitor logs with `kubectl logs <namespace> <pod-name>`.

## Contributing
Feel free to extend the README with usage examples and troubleshooting tips.
