# Kubernetes Cluster Management Scripts

This repository contains scripts and manifests for managing a Kubernetes cluster, including port forwarding, monitoring, and database configurations.

## Overview

This project focuses on automating the setup and maintenance of a Kubernetes cluster using various services and tools like kube-apiserver, kubectl, kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Prometheus Operator, and Databases Manager.

## Directory Structure

- `src/scripts/`: Commands for starting, monitoring, and managing cluster components.
- `src/managing/`: Helm manifests to deploy services.
- `src/databases/`: Database configurations (Redis, Postgres).
- `src/test-service/`: Sample Kubernetes `echo` service for testing.
- `src/managing/portainer-values.yaml`: Configuration files for Portainer deployment.

## Important Commands

- `make cluster`: Initializes the cluster.
- `make monitors`: Makes monitoring services available.
- `make managers`: Installs and starts Portainer management UI.
- `make databases`: Deploys Redis and PostgreSQL databases.
- `make port-forward`: Converts manifests to run forwarded ports.
- `make status`: Lists running pods in the monitoring namespace.
- `make ping-redis`: Tests Redis connectivity.
- `make ping-postgres`: Tests PostgreSQL connectivity.

## Readme Highlights

- **PID Directory**: Stores process ID files for handling PID namespaces.
- **Service Deployments**: Kubernetes manifests for Grafana, Prometheus, Portainer, Redis, and Postgres.
- **Networking**: Configured by `port-forward.sh` for service exposure.
- **Security**: `redis` and `postgres` added as secrets containing standard credentials.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Set up cluster credentials (e.g., kubeconfig file).
3. Run automated setup: `make cluster`
4. Start monitoring: `make monitors`
5. Access dashboards: `http://localhost:3000` for Grafana.

## Requirements

- Docker installed
- kubectl installed and configured
- Helm installed
- Kubernetes API server running
